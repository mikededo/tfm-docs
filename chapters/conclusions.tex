\chapter{Conclusions}
The flight information requirements for individuals who undertake frequent trips
are increasing as technology and access to data advance. Therefore, relying on
one-off search tools that require users to conduct individual searches to meet
their travel needs is no longer feasible, especially when they have fixed routes
that repeat in specific daily cycles, whether for work, academic, or established
project purposes.

During the project development, our team has been dedicated to understanding
this need and has endeavoured to offer software that timely satisfies this type
of traveller, automating flight search processes and establishing intelligent
algorithms that enable the comparison of offers and notification of the most
suitable ones. It has been very interesting to meet this type of user and
understand the time they devote to individually searching for frequently
undertaken trips. Therefore, we highly value the proposal of \emph{Recurrent
	Travellers} application.

However, the risks and time limitations described in the corresponding section
were part of the final delivered outcome. The delivered software is useful and
meets the primary user need, but it has the potential to grow, become more
user-friendly, capture more preferences, and even connect to more data sources
both for obtaining flight information and providing more comprehensive
notifications to users.
